# Predict Corp Bankruptcy
 The objective of this project is to use RandomForest and XGBoost to accurately predict a company's likelihood to go into bankruptcy based on financial information provided in arff file formats. The financial data consists of a set of 64 attributes each one containing data such as net profits by total assets or total assets by total liabilities. Typically a decision maker may be able to pick out a few traditional attributes to guide their gut feeling on a company to invest in or give a loan to. However, the benefit of the two machine learning models in our study is that they can analysis at a wide variety of attributes, many of which are very similar to each other, and determine which ones are empirically the most important, regardless of conventional knowledge. And, if the most important attributes happen to be those that are frequently used anyways, at least there is data backing that up.
